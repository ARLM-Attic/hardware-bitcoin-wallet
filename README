Hardware BitCoin Wallet
by someone42, unless stated otherwise

A minimal BitCoin (see http://bitcoin.org/ ) wallet for embedded devices. The
wallet is responsible for parsing transactions, prompting the user and signing
transactions. It is not aware of the blockchain and communicates with a
BitCoin client ("the host" from the point of view of the code here) via. a
point-to-point stream-based link.

Everything in the top-level source directory is self-contained and should be
platform-independent. The only platform-dependent file there is common.h,
which should be modified if porting to other platforms. hwinterface.h
describes what platform-dependent functions need to be implemented.

Everything in the avr/ subdirectory is specific to the 8-bit AVR platform.
