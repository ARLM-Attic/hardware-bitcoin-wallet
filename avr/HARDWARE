Hardware connections:

The files here expect the following hardware:
- A hardware random number generator (see adc.c for the pin to connect it to),
- A 2-line HD44780-based LCD (see lcd_and_input.c for the pins to connect it
  to) and
- Two push buttons (see lcd_and_input.c for the pins to connect it to) which
  connect between an input pin and ground.

Communication with the host BitCoin client is done via. the USART.
