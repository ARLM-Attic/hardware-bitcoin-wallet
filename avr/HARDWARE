Hardware connections:

The files here expect the following hardware:
- A hardware noise source (see adc.c for the pin to connect it to),
- An optional charge pump, perhaps to drive the noise source (see
- adc.c for the pins to connect it to),
- A 2-line HD44780-based LCD (see lcd_and_input.c for the pins to connect it
  to) and
- Two push buttons (see lcd_and_input.c for the pins to connect it to) which
  connect between an input pin and ground.

Communication with the host is done via. the USART at baud rate 57600,
8 data bits, no parity and 1 stop bit.
