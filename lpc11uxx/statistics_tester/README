statistics_tester.c is a program which tests the statistical tests running
on the device. It needs test vectors, which can be generated by
generate_test_vectors.m

Compile statistics_tester.c with something like:
gcc -Os -o statistics_tester statistics_tester.c
and run it with something like ./statistics_tester /dev/ttyUSB0

The device firmware should be compiled with the TEST_STATISTICS preprocessor
directive defined.
