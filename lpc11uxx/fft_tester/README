fft_tester.c is a program which tests a FFT implementation running on the
device. It needs test vectors, which can be generated by
generate_test_vectors.m

Compile fft_tester.c with something like: gcc -Os -o fft_tester fft_tester.c
and run it with something like ./fft_tester /dev/ttyUSB0

The device firmware should be compiled with the TEST_FFT preprocessor
directive defined.
