The LPC11Uxx port will not compile as it is now, as it's missing:
- CMSIS header files
- Register definitions
- A Makefile
- Startup code
- A linker script
These haven't been included due to licensing issues.

The CMSIS header files and register definitions can be downloaded from:
http://ics.nxp.com/support/lpcxpresso/
(CMSIS Library for LPC11Uxx)
The files to extract from that package: core_cm0.h, core_cmFunc.h,
core_cmInstr.h, LPC11Uxx.h and system_LPC11Uxx.h.

As for the Makefile, startup code and linker script, the "lpc1114_blink_led"
example from http://www.freddiechopin.info has code which will work. The
"__process_stack_size" variable in the linker script does need to be changed
to something bigger (try "__process_stack_size = 6144"). The "SRCS_DIRS = "
line in the Makefile also needs to be changed to "SRCS_DIRS = .." to include
all the platform-independent code.
