The LPC11Uxx port will not compile as it is now, as it's missing CMSIS header
files and register definitions.

These haven't been included due to licensing issues.

The CMSIS header files and register definitions can be downloaded from:
http://ics.nxp.com/support/lpcxpresso/
(CMSIS Library for LPC11Uxx)
The files to extract from that package: core_cm0.h, core_cmFunc.h,
core_cmInstr.h, LPC11Uxx.h and system_LPC11Uxx.h.
