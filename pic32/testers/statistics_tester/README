statistics_tester.c is a program which tests the statistical tests running
on the device. It needs test vectors, which can be generated by
generate_test_vectors.m
It also requires HIDAPI to be installed as a shared library.

Compile statistics_tester.c with something like:
gcc -o statistics_tester statistics_tester.c -I<path to HIDAPI includes> -lhidapi -L<path to HIDAPI libraries>

The device firmware should be compiled with the TEST_STATISTICS preprocessor
directive defined.
